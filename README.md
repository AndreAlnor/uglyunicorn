# uglyunicorn
uglyunicorn is a label and set of values defined and maintained by a group of individuals in the digitalization deparmentment of Energinet, the Danish electricity and gad transmission system operator. In order to be transparent and invite for open collaboration with likeminded souls, the label and valueset is shared an a open source library.
 
Uglyunicorn is not just a group of people, it's a mind set, a set of values, a paradigm and a conceptual approach to software engineering for complex software systems, it is a movement.
This means that thoes aknowledge and adobt these values often work differently than others, use different tools. As a community we are not any one thing, we are whatever we need to be to get the job done.

We are NOT what you would call Enterprise IT and we embrace that.
But! We are not goth/punk-whatever teenagers either. We are not different for the purpose of being different. We are different when we need to be, and we need to solve problems that no one has solved before us. We need to do this in a business critical setting, we need to do it in a way that pushes others to change behavior, processes, tools and culture, we need to do a lot in order to enable the green ener-gy transition - because that is what is at stake.

Rules to live by:
Open source first, not only
We consume, create and contribute to open source projects almost always.

Enable self service
We design with self service in mind â€“ our main contribution to Energinet and society is the solutions we enable others to create.

Tools for the trade
The problems we try to solve define the tools we use and create.

We share responsibility
We make decisions as a team, hierarchy is a last resort

Speed is at the heart of everything we do
We make decisions fast, our services are born fast, we deliver value fast

We remove technical debt even when it hurts
We change always, killing our darlings and improve, but ALWAYS in a blame free environment
